## What I worked on
- Set up Ubuntu 24.04 environment
- Created DevOps apprenticeship GitHub repository
- Configured Git, SSH authentication, and repo structure

## Issues / friction
- Faced GitHub push authentication failure due to deprecated password auth
- Needed to understand SSH keys and agent usage

## What I understand better today
- How SSH authentication works with GitHub
- Why SSH keys are preferred over passwords for Git operations
- Why repository structure and clean commits matter from day one
