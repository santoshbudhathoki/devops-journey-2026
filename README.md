# devops-journey-2026

This repository documents my project-based DevOps apprenticeship roadmap (2026). Every phase produces real deliverables that are documented, reproducible, and version-controlled.

## Why DevOps exists
DevOps exists to reduce the gap between building software and running it in production by improving delivery speed and reliability through shared ownership, automation, and fast feedback.

## Why I am learning DevOps
[EDIT: 2–3 sentences about your goal in Australia and the kind of DevOps work you want.]

## How this repo works
- One phase at a time. No skipping.
- Every phase ends with deliverables (code, configs, notes, evidence).
- If it is not documented and reproducible, it does not count.
- Work is organised by phase folders and a daily engineering journal.

## Structure
- `journal/` Daily log of decisions, failures, fixes, and learnings
- `phase-0/` Orientation and environment setup
- Future phases will include build, deploy, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and ops deliverables
